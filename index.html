                <h1>Hi, I'm Prashant!</h1>
                <p>I'm a Senior Product Manager based in Seattle, WA. 🏙️</p>
                <p>I like 🏔️ hiking, 🎨 making paintings, and ⚽ playing soccer.</p>
                <p>I've worked as a software developer for many years before pivoting to functional roles such as pre-sales and program management, ultimately finding my calling in product management.</p>
                <p>I spend a significant time <a href="community.html">mentoring aspiring product managers</a>, with a keen focus on finding the 'why' before the 'how', even for career aspirations. 🚀</p>
