            <h1>Hi, I'm Prashant!</h1>
            <p>I'm a Senior Product Manager based in Seattle, WA. üèôÔ∏è</p>
            <p>With over 13 years of experience, I specialize in building and scaling globally used SaaS products. Currently, I'm leading product vision and strategy at Avalara, where we provide best-in-class tax and compliance solutions via APIs to industry-leading SaaS and ERP platforms.</p>
            <p>My journey in tech has taken me from being a developer at Tata Consultancy Services to roles in product management at companies like Oracle, Spacelabs Healthcare, and now Avalara. I'm passionate about solving complex problems, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and delivering products that create real value for users and businesses alike.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy mentoring aspiring Product Managers through ADPList, sharing my experiences and insights from the industry. üöÄ</p>
